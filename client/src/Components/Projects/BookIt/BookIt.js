                I created Book It to solve the common problem of losing bookmarked links. Remember that one article you wanted to read, but you saved it for later? Did you save it on your phone, or was it on your laptop this time? On which app did you save it? Book It allows you to have one central place to access all of your bookmarks in categorized and appearance-personalized lists.

            <h3>Planning</h3>
                <p>
                    To get my project organized, I created a project proposal to outline my goals. This allowed me to get a clear and tangible idea of how I wanted to structure my application to meet those goals. My proposal greatly aided me in creating a neat and functioning composition.
